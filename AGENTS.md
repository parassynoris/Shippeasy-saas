# Agent Coding Guidelines

*Practical reference for agents making code changes in this monorepo.*

## Repository Structure

```
shipeasy/              # Angular 13 frontend (PWA)
shipeasy-api/          # Node.js / Express backend (REST API)
docs/                  # Compliance and CI/CD documentation
.github/workflows/     # GitHub Actions (manual fallback)
azure-pipelines.yml    # Primary CI/CD pipeline
docker-compose.yml     # Production Docker Compose
docker-compose.dev.yml # Development Docker Compose (hot reload)
deploy.sh              # EC2 deployment script
```

This is a monorepo with two independent apps. There are no npm/yarn workspaces — each app has its own `package.json` and dependency management.

## Build & Run Commands

### Backend (`shipeasy-api/`)

```bash
npm install
npm start           # runs node index.js on port 3000
npm test            # Jest with --testTimeout=5000 --detectOpenHandles
```

### Frontend (`shipeasy/`)

```bash
yarn install
yarn start          # dev server on port 4200 (proxies /api/* to backend)
yarn test           # Karma + Jasmine unit tests
yarn lint           # ESLint via Angular ESLint
yarn e2e            # Protractor E2E tests
```

For CI-style headless testing: `yarn test --watch=false --browsers=ChromeHeadless`

### Docker (repo root)

```bash
docker compose up --build -d                                                    # production
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml up --build       # dev (hot reload)
```

## Code Style & Conventions

### Frontend (Angular / TypeScript)

- **Linter**: ESLint (`.eslintrc.json`). Legacy TSLint config (`tslint.json`) also exists but ESLint is authoritative.
- **Component selectors**: element selectors, prefix `app`, kebab-case (e.g., `app-my-component`).
- **Directive selectors**: attribute selectors, prefix `app`, camelCase (e.g., `appMyDirective`).
- **Quotes**: single quotes.
- **Semicolons**: always.
- **Max line length**: 140 characters.
- **Console usage**: `console.info` and `console.error` only — `console.log`, `console.debug`, `console.warn` are errors.
- **Unused variables**: treated as errors.
- **Indentation**: spaces (not tabs).
- **Member ordering**: static fields, instance fields, static methods, instance methods.
- **Stylesheets**: SCSS.
- **Module structure**: `admin/`, `layout/`, `auth/`, `models/`, `services/`, `shared/` under `src/app/`.
- **Spec files**: colocated with their components as `*.spec.ts`.

### Backend (Node.js)

- **Module system**: CommonJS (`require` / `module.exports`).
- **Entry point**: `index.js`.
- **Directory layout**: `router/`, `service/`, `services/`, `schema/`, `middleware/`, `controller/`, `utils/`, `tests/`.
- No ESLint or Prettier config — follow existing code style.

## Testing

### Backend

- **Framework**: Jest 29 with Supertest for HTTP assertions.
- **Test location**: `shipeasy-api/tests/`.
- **CI command**: `npm test -- --ci --forceExit --reporters=jest-junit`
- **Environment**: set `NODE_ENV=test`.

### Frontend

- **Framework**: Karma + Jasmine.
- **Test location**: `*.spec.ts` files colocated with source files (~384 spec files).
- **Coverage output**: `coverage/baxi/`.
- **CI command**: `yarn test --watch=false --browsers=ChromeHeadless`
- **E2E**: Protractor (`e2e/src/**/*.e2e-spec.ts`), base URL `http://localhost:4200/`.

## CI/CD Pipeline

The primary CI system is **Azure Pipelines** (`azure-pipelines.yml` at the repo root).

Pipeline stages:
1. **DetectChanges** — git diff to determine which app(s) changed.
2. **Test** — runs backend (Jest, Node 22) and frontend (Karma headless, Node 20) tests conditionally.
3. **BuildPush** — builds Docker images, pushes to ACR (only on push to `main`).
4. **Deploy** — SSH to AWS EC2 and runs `deploy.sh` (only on push to `main`).

Triggers: pushes and PRs to `main` that touch `shipeasy/`, `shipeasy-api/`, `docker-compose.yml`, `azure-pipelines.yml`, or `deploy.sh`.

## Important Notes

- The frontend package name is `smartagent` and the Angular project name is `baxi` (in `angular.json`); the build output goes to `dist/smartagent`.
- The frontend dev server proxies `/api/*` requests via `src/proxy.conf.json` — this may point to a remote URL by default; adjust for local backend development.
- Backend environment variables are configured via `.env` (see `.env.example`). Required vars include `MONGO_CONNECTION`, `SECRET_KEY_JWT`, and various service credentials.
- Frontend environment config lives in `shipeasy/src/environments/environment.ts` and variant files (`environment.prod.ts`, `environment.dev.ts`, `environment.demo.ts`, `environment.indianproduction.ts`).
- The frontend uses `--max_old_space_size=6096` for the dev server and `4096` for tests due to Angular 13's memory requirements.
- Frontend CI tests use `continueOnError: true` — the test suite is not yet fully stable.

## 1. Project Overview

**Shippeasy** is a full-stack, multi-tenant SaaS platform for logistics, freight forwarding, and shipping management. It serves freight forwarding agents, shipping lines, warehouse operators, and their end-customers (shippers/consignees) through a unified web application.

The platform digitizes the entire freight lifecycle — from enquiry and quotation, through booking and shipment execution, to invoicing, compliance documentation, and warehouse management. It supports ocean, air, rail, and land transport modes with real-time container tracking, automated milestone management, and regulatory compliance (EDI, e-Invoicing, IGM/EGM, shipping bills).

**Business model**: Multi-tenant SaaS with per-organization (`orgId`) data isolation. Includes a trial period with automatic expiration and user disabling. Supports customer self-service portals alongside full agent/admin back-offices.

**Target users**:
- **Freight forwarding agents** — primary users managing the full shipment lifecycle
- **Shipping line operators** — carrier booking and vessel/voyage management
- **Warehouse operators** — inward/outward operations, gate entries, dispatch, surveyor reports
- **Shippers / Consignees** — self-service quotation requests, shipment tracking, document access
- **Finance teams** — invoicing, payments, credit/debit notes, TDS, Tally sync
- **Operations managers** — dashboards, reports, milestone tracking, automation configuration

**Key differentiators**:
- End-to-end freight lifecycle management in a single platform
- Multi-modal transport support (ocean, air, rail, land)
- AI-powered document scanning (BL scanning via OpenAI, invoice scanning via Gemini)
- Real-time container tracking via ULIP government API integration
- Integrated warehouse management system
- WhatsApp Business API integration for customer communication
- Automated workflows and triggers for email, notifications, and report generation
- GST e-invoicing compliance via Zircon API (India market)

```

### Request Flow

1. **Browser** loads Angular SPA from nginx (port 80)
2. **API calls** from Angular hit `/api/*` which nginx reverse-proxies to Express (port 3000)
3. **WebSocket** connections (Socket.io) are proxied through nginx with upgrade support
4. **Express middleware** chain: CORS → JSON parser → request tracer → auth (`validateAuth`) → controller
5. **Authentication**: JWT verification or Google OAuth token validation; user/agent/org context resolved
6. **Business logic** in controllers reads/writes MongoDB via Mongoose; all queries scoped by `orgId`
7. **File operations** go through Azure Blob Storage (`@azure/storage-blob`)
8. **Real-time events** are broadcast via Socket.io to connected clients (`data-change`, `inAppNotification`, `messages`)
9. **Background jobs** run via 16 node-cron schedulers (email, tracking, expiry, reports)
10. **Email queue** processed by BullMQ workers backed by Redis

### API Design

The backend uses a **hybrid API pattern**:

- **Named endpoints** (~60 routes) for complex business operations (e.g., `/api/scan-bl`, `/api/edi/:ediName/:documentId`, `/api/sent-to-einvoicing/:invoiceId`)
- **Generic CRUD endpoints** for standard data operations on any of the 87 Mongoose models:
  - `POST /api/search/:indexName/:id?` — read/search
  - `POST /api/:indexName` — insert
  - `PUT /api/:indexName/:id` — update
  - `DELETE /api/:indexName/:id` — delete
  - Validated by `checkIndex` middleware against the schema registry

### Docker Compose Services

| Service | Image | Ports | Volumes |
|---------|-------|-------|---------|
| **mongo** | `mongo:6` | internal only (dev: 27017) | `mongo_data:/data/db` |
| **backend** | `${BACKEND_IMAGE}:${BACKEND_TAG}` | 3000 | `logs_data:/app/logs`, env from `.env` |
| **frontend** | `${FRONTEND_IMAGE}:${FRONTEND_TAG}` | 80 (dev: 4200) | none (dev: source bind mount) |

Network: `shipeasy_net` (bridge).

# Engineering Improvements — Changelog

*Implemented by the senior engineering team across security, code quality, performance, and SaaS readiness.*

---

## Security Improvements

### 1. Helmet Security Headers (`middleware/security.js`)
- Added `helmet` middleware as the first layer in the Express pipeline
- Protects against XSS, clickjacking, MIME sniffing, and other common attacks
- CSP and COEP disabled to avoid breaking the Angular SPA

### 2. CORS Lockdown (`middleware/security.js`)
- **Before**: `cors()` with no config + manual `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` header — any origin could call any API
- **After**: CORS configured to read allowed origins from `CORS_ORIGINS` env var (comma-separated list)
- Removed the duplicate manual CORS header middleware from `index.js`
- Exposes only `X-Trace-Id` header, credentials enabled

### 3. Rate Limiting (`middleware/security.js`)
- **Global**: 1000 requests per 15-minute window per IP
- **Auth endpoints**: 20 attempts per 15-minute window (login, password reset, password change)
- **Upload endpoints**: 50 uploads per 15-minute window
- Returns standard `RateLimit-*` headers per RFC draft

### 4. NoSQL Injection Prevention (`middleware/security.js`)
- `express-mongo-sanitize` strips `$` and `.` operators from request bodies, query strings, and params
- Prevents attackers from injecting MongoDB operators like `$gt`, `$ne`, `$regex` into queries
- Logs sanitization events for security monitoring

### 5. HTTP Parameter Pollution Protection (`middleware/security.js`)
- `hpp` middleware prevents duplicate query parameter attacks
- Whitelists `sort`, `fields`, `page`, `limit` for legitimate multi-value use

### 6. Input Validation (`middleware/validateRequest.js`)
- Login: validates Username and Password presence, length limits
- Password reset: validates email format and userLogin presence
- CRUD endpoints: validates `indexName` is alphanumeric (2-50 chars), `id` is present and bounded
- File downloads: validates `fileName` against path traversal (`..`, `/`, `\`)
- All validation uses `express-validator` with structured error responses

### 7. Centralized Error Handler (`middleware/errorHandler.js`)
- **Before**: No catch-all error handler — errors could leak stack traces to clients
- **After**: `AppError` class for operational errors, `globalErrorHandler` for all uncaught errors
- Handles: `ValidationError`, `CastError`, duplicate key (`E11000`), `JsonWebTokenError`, `TokenExpiredError`
- Stack traces hidden in production; only operational error messages exposed to clients
- 404 handler for undefined routes

### 8. Request Tracer Hardening (`middleware/requestTracer.js`)
- **Fixed**: JWT parsing bug — `replace("Bearer").slice()` didn't handle the space correctly
- **Fixed**: Hardcoded encryption key fallback removed — `ENCRYPTION_KEY` must be set via env
- **Fixed**: Sensitive headers (Authorization, Cookie, x-api-key) no longer logged in full
- **Fixed**: Response bodies no longer logged in production (prevented sensitive data exposure)
- Structured, minimal request logging in non-production only

### 9. Auth Middleware Refactor (`middleware/auth.js`)
- **Before**: 114 lines with duplicate user validation logic (JWT path and Google OAuth path were copy-paste)
- **After**: Extracted `resolveUserContext()` and `checkUserStatus()` shared helpers — DRY
- Proper Bearer token extraction with space handling
- Token length validation before attempting verification
- Structured error logging via Winston instead of raw `console.error`

### 10. Swagger UI Protection (`index.js`)
- **Before**: Swagger UI exposed unconditionally at `/api-docs`
- **After**: Disabled in production unless `ENABLE_SWAGGER=true` is set

### 11. Safe External Client Initialization
- **Fixed**: Azure Blob Storage client crash when `AZURE_CONNECTION_STRING` not set (both `azureStorageContoller.js` and `schedulers.js`)
- **Fixed**: OpenAI client crash when `OPENAI_API` not set (`helper.controller.js`)
- All external clients now initialize conditionally — app boots even without all credentials

### 12. Graceful Shutdown (`index.js`)
- Added `SIGTERM` / `SIGINT` handlers for clean shutdown
- Closes HTTP server, then MongoDB connection, then exits
- 30-second forced-shutdown timeout as safety net
- `unhandledRejection` and `uncaughtException` handlers with proper logging

### 13. Body Size Limit Reduction (`index.js`)
- **Before**: `50mb` JSON body limit
- **After**: `10mb` — still generous but prevents abuse; upload endpoints use multer separately

---

## Code Quality Improvements

### 1. Middleware Architecture
New middleware layer structure:

```
middleware/
├── auth.js              # Refactored — DRY auth with JWT + Google OAuth
├── checkIndex.js        # Existing — CRUD collection validation
├── errorHandler.js      # NEW — AppError class + global error handler
├── requestTracer.js     # Refactored — fixed bugs, removed sensitive logging
├── security.js          # NEW — Helmet, CORS, rate limiting, sanitization
├── tenantIsolation.js   # NEW — orgId enforcement + RBAC helpers
└── validateRequest.js   # NEW — express-validator rules for all endpoint types
```

### 2. Eliminated Duplicate Code
- Auth middleware reduced from 114 lines with copy-paste to 117 lines with clean shared functions
- Contact form auth handler now safely handles missing Authorization header

### 3. Structured Logging
- Consolidated on Winston (`utils/logger.js`) as the standard logger
- Request tracer no longer logs full request/response bodies in production
- Security events (sanitization, auth failures, permission denials) logged with trace context

### 4. Process Stability
- Unhandled promise rejections and uncaught exceptions are now caught and logged
- Server errors trigger `process.exit(1)` instead of hanging silently

---

## Performance Improvements

### 1. Database Indexes (`schema/indexes.js`)
Added 60+ indexes across 25 collections. Applied after MongoDB connection is established:

| Collection | Indexes Added |
|-----------|---------------|
| `users` | `userLogin` (unique), `userEmail`, `orgId+userStatus`, `orgId+userType`, `tokenVersion` |
| `agents` | `agentId` (unique), `isTrial+trialValidTill` |
| `batchs` | `batchId` (unique), `orgId`, `orgId+statusOfBatch`, `orgId+createdOn` |
| `enquirys` | `enquiryId` (unique), `orgId`, `orgId+createdOn` |
| `quotations` | `quotationId` (unique), `orgId`, `orgId+quoteStatus`, `orgId+validTo` |
| `invoices` | `invoiceId` (unique), `orgId`, `batchId`, `orgId+createdOn` |
| `transactions` | `transactionId` (unique), `orgId`, `batchId`, `invoiceId` |
| `containers` | `containerId` (unique), `batchId`, `containerNumber`, `orgId` |
| `documents` | `documentId` (unique), `batchId`, `orgId` |
| `bls` | `blId` (unique), `batchId`, `orgId+blType`, `blNumber` |
| `events` | `eventId` (unique), `entityId`, `entityId+eventTag` |
| `inappnotifications` | `userId+isRead`, `orgId`, `createdOn` |
| `logaudits` | `resource+resourceId`, `recordedOn`, `traceId` |
| ... | *and 12 more collections* |

All indexes created with `background: true` to avoid blocking production queries.

### 2. APM Sample Rate Optimization (`index.js`)
- **Before**: `transactionSampleRate: 1.0` and `captureBody: 'all'` in all environments
- **After**: Production uses `0.5` sample rate and `captureBody: 'errors'` only — reduces APM overhead by ~50%

---

## SaaS Architecture Improvements

### 1. Tenant Isolation Middleware (`middleware/tenantIsolation.js`)
- **Before**: `orgId` filtering was ad-hoc — each controller had to remember to add it to queries
- **After**: Centralized `enforceTenantIsolation` middleware automatically injects `orgId` into:
  - Search queries (`req.body.query.orgId = orgId`)
  - Insert operations (`req.body.orgId = orgId`)
- SuperAdmin users bypass tenant filtering
- Global collections (`country`, `state`, `city`, `port`, `currency`, `commodity`, `airportmaster`) are exempt
- Applied to all generic CRUD routes (`/:indexName`, `/search/:indexName`)

### 2. Role-Based Access Control Helpers (`middleware/tenantIsolation.js`)
- `requireRole(...roles)` — middleware that checks if the user has any of the specified roles
- `requireFeature(slug)` — middleware that checks if the organization has a specific feature enabled
- Both can be composed onto any route: `router.post('/admin/config', validateAuth, requireRole('admin'), handler)`

### 3. Tenant Context Propagation
- `req.tenantContext` object available to all downstream handlers with: `orgId`, `userId`, `userType`, `isSuperAdmin`
- Enables future subscription/billing checks at the middleware level

---
